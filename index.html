      Do you remember this moment, love?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center">
I’m sure you do. That moment quietly marked the beginning of something I didn’t realize I was waiting for.
We first truly met here, though I had known you in my own way long before. Yet, it was here that a new chapter in my life began—a chapter that would come to mean more to me than I could have imagined.
Life has a way of surprising us. The smallest moments, the simplest encounters, often shape the deepest connections. What we do not plan, what we do not expect, can sometimes become the most meaningful. I have learned that when the Creator moves in your life, even ordinary days carry extraordinary purpose. Every chance meeting, every shared laugh, every small gesture has a reason, a lesson, and a hidden blessing.
I am grateful—truly grateful—that I have spent an entire year with you by my side. In that time, I have tried to show my love not only through words, but through actions: being present when you needed help, offering support in schoolwork, standing close even in the smallest ways. True love, I have come to understand, is not merely spoken; it is lived, it is consistent, it is patient.
And through it all, I’ve realized something important: life’s most valuable lessons often come in the quietest, simplest moments. The moments we may overlook at first glance, yet later we see they were shaping us, teaching us, guiding us. That is exactly what you have been for me—a guide, a teacher, and the most beautiful part of my story.
I love you with intention, with gratitude, and with a heart that is humbled and inspired by you. This love is not fleeting; it is steady, it is purposeful, and it is a reflection of everything I have learned about life, about faith, and about what it means to care for someone completely.

      JS Prom — the night I understood what happiness truly feels like.
There was a part of that night when I felt a little heavy, because I couldn’t dance with you right away. I even thought you didn’t really want to, and that feeling quietly tested my heart. But life has a gentle way of rewarding patience. When the moment finally came and I held you in my arms on the dance floor, everything I had worried about simply disappeared.
I was genuinely happy.
That night was something my heart had been wishing for long before it happened. Until now, I still struggle to fully explain what I felt then. It was different — rare. Back then, I already admired you deeply, and being able to dance with you wasn’t just a moment, it was a realization: sometimes, what we long for most arrives when we least expect it, and when it does, it teaches us gratitude more than excitement.
As we danced, the noise of the crowd, the brightness of the lights, and the presence of everyone else slowly lost their meaning. My attention rested only on you. In a world full of distractions, I learned that connection happens when two people choose to be present for each other. I felt the warmth of your hand, and in that simple touch, I understood how powerful quiet moments can be.
You were the one I wanted to be with that night, and honestly, I didn’t want to go home. Not because of the place, but because peace feels different when you are beside me.
Dancing with you, holding your hand, hearing “Treat Me Like a Rose” and then “This I Promise You” — those weren’t just songs. They became memories that taught me something valuable: the most meaningful moments in life are not planned for perfection, but felt with sincerity.
That night didn’t just make me smile.
It taught me what it means to cherish someone in the middle of a busy, noisy world — and still find calm in just one person.

      As we grew closer and closer, being together became something we both naturally wanted.
I still remember the first time we held hands.
That simple moment already felt like a victory.
It was quiet, but inside me, everything was loud — my heart racing faster than I could control. Until now, I still find it hard to explain what it truly felt like. Because some emotions, especially the ones born from genuine connection, cannot be understood through words alone. You have to experience them to realize their meaning.
But if I try to put it into words, this is how it felt to me:
The world suddenly felt safe.
Even when the surroundings were full of noise and chaos, my heart became calm. In your hand, I found peace. Your touch, your presence — they were enough to quiet the fears I carried. The fear of being hurt again. The fear of trusting too much.
Yet through you, I learned something important: not everyone is the same. Some people are different for a reason. You are different, my love. You are rare. There is only one you, and no one else will ever replace what you are to me.
Because loving you did not only give me happiness —
it taught me courage.

      We would go home together after school.
Sometimes we were tired. Sometimes quiet. But we were together, and that was already enough. In those ordinary moments—when we were doing modules at our place—I began to feel the meaning of us more deeply. Not the loud kind of love, but the calm, steady one that grows in silence.
It taught me something important: love does not always show itself in grand gestures. Most of the time, it lives in the simple routines we choose to share.
Our walks were simple. Our plans were simple. Ice cream—your comfort food. Gently bringing food to your room so you would have something to eat. Not because I had to, but because caring means paying attention to the small things. I never wanted you to feel hungry, tired, or forgotten, even in the smallest ways.
All those days became special to me for one reason only—you were the one beside me.
Not because of the places we went.
Not because of the food we shared.
But because presence gives meaning to everything.
I will never get tired of saying that, love. Because I’ve learned this truth: when the right person is with you, even the most ordinary day becomes something worth remembering.
And for me, you were always that person.

      Our KTV moments together.
My voice may not be perfect, but my heart always is when I’m with you. As long as we’re together, everything already feels right. Singing beside you taught me something simple yet important: happiness doesn’t come from sounding good, it comes from sharing a moment with someone who matters.
In every song I choose, I choose you. Because in truth, all the songs I sing carry your name in them. And when I say “I can treat you better,” I don’t mean it as a line — I mean it as a promise I live by.
Cooking for you.
Picking you up.
Taking care of you.
Loving you.
Being there when you’re sick.
Supporting your dreams.
Real love is not measured by what we say, but by what we consistently do.
Everything you hope for, everything you work toward, I want to support as much as I can, while I still have the strength to show you how valuable you are to me. Not only through affection, but through commitment, patience, and respect.
And if the days come when we are both tired — when there are misunderstandings, quiet moments, or even tears — I won’t walk away. Not because love is easy, but because love is worth choosing even when it asks for strength.
You are not just someone I love.
You are someone who gives me rest — emotionally and mentally.
So if we can, love, let’s keep choosing each other.
Not because we are perfect,
but because we are willing to grow together.
Let’s not give up on what we are building, on what we already have.

      Look at us, biting our medals.
We were honor students that day, yet what made me prouder wasn’t the medal around my neck — it was the person standing beside me. Achievements feel different when they are shared with someone who understands your struggles, your effort, and your quiet sacrifices.
Yes, we look cute there, almost playful. But behind that smile is something deeper: two people who kept choosing to move forward despite pressure, fatigue, and doubt. That picture reminds me that success is not only about reaching the top, but about who walks with you on the way there.
You became more than just my partner in moments — you became my inspiration. Seeing you work hard, stay gentle, and remain strong in your own way pushed me to become better too. Not out of competition, but out of love. Because when you admire someone deeply, you don’t want to stay the same — you want to grow.
That medal symbolizes effort.
But you symbolize purpose.
You remind me why I try harder, why I stay focused, and why I believe that dreams are more beautiful when they are shared. With you, success is no longer just personal — it becomes meaningful, grounded, and worth celebrating.
So yes, we were honor students.
But more than that, we were two hearts learning that inspiration, love, and growth go hand in hand.
And that, to me, is the real achievement

      Isa ka sa mga pangarap na natupad ko. Sinabi ko rin naman sa'yo, at pinangako ko na dadalhin kita dito diba? kaya tinupad ko. Sobrang sayaaa, those hugs and simple kisses sa sasakyan🥹 I feel like I have butterfliessss in my stomachhhhhhhhh. Sa gabing ’yon, love,
hindi lang tayo nanood ng concert kundi
gumawa tayo ng isang pangarap at pangako na naging totoo.
At kung may isa pa akong pangarap,
’yon ay madala kita sa mas marami pang lugar,
mas marami pang adventures,and new discovery 
at mas marami pang memories na tayo lang ang bida, tayo lang dalawa.

      Outing with your family sa Wawa.
That day, mas lalo kitang nakilala, at mas lalo rin akong nakilala sa mga mahal mo sa buhay.
I realized na love isn’t just about being together in private, kundi about being comfortable with the people who matter to each of us.
I saw how you interact with your family, how you care, how you laugh, and it made me appreciate even more the person that you are.
Being there with you, I also learned that love isn’t just words — it’s in the small things we do for each other.
Even something simple, like sharing a Coke or helping out when needed, means a lot when it comes from the heart.
It reminded me that true care is shown in consistency, patience, and thoughtfulness — not just in big gestures.
I felt so grateful that day, because I could see how we’re slowly becoming part of each other’s lives in a deeper, more meaningful way.
It’s not about grand moments or perfection, it’s about presence, understanding, and building trust.
Being with you, and seeing how we both fit naturally with each other’s families, made me realize that love is also about harmony, respect, and mutual growth.
That outing wasn’t just a day out; it was a reminder that the best kind of love is patient, grounded, and aware of the people and the world around us.
It made me reflect on how I want to be the kind of person who can give you safety, comfort, and joy, not just now, but in all the moments that life will bring our way.
I left that day feeling even more certain:
I want to share not just my happiness, but my life with you — in all its simplicity, in all its challenges, and in all the quiet moments in between.
