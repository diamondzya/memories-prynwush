      Do you remember this moment, love?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center">
I’m sure you do. That moment quietly marked the beginning of something I didn’t realize I was waiting for.
We first truly met here, though I had known you in my own way long before. Yet, it was here that a new chapter in my life began—a chapter that would come to mean more to me than I could have imagined.
Life has a way of surprising us. The smallest moments, the simplest encounters, often shape the deepest connections. What we do not plan, what we do not expect, can sometimes become the most meaningful. I have learned that when the Creator moves in your life, even ordinary days carry extraordinary purpose. Every chance meeting, every shared laugh, every small gesture has a reason, a lesson, and a hidden blessing.
I am grateful—truly grateful—that I have spent an entire year with you by my side. In that time, I have tried to show my love not only through words, but through actions: being present when you needed help, offering support in schoolwork, standing close even in the smallest ways. True love, I have come to understand, is not merely spoken; it is lived, it is consistent, it is patient.
And through it all, I’ve realized something important: life’s most valuable lessons often come in the quietest, simplest moments. The moments we may overlook at first glance, yet later we see they were shaping us, teaching us, guiding us. That is exactly what you have been for me—a guide, a teacher, and the most beautiful part of my story.
I love you with intention, with gratitude, and with a heart that is humbled and inspired by you. This love is not fleeting; it is steady, it is purposeful, and it is a reflection of everything I have learned about life, about faith, and about what it means to care for someone completely.

      JS Prom — the night I understood what happiness truly feels like.
There was a part of that night when I felt a little heavy, because I couldn’t dance with you right away. I even thought you didn’t really want to, and that feeling quietly tested my heart. But life has a gentle way of rewarding patience. When the moment finally came and I held you in my arms on the dance floor, everything I had worried about simply disappeared.
I was genuinely happy.
That night was something my heart had been wishing for long before it happened. Until now, I still struggle to fully explain what I felt then. It was different — rare. Back then, I already admired you deeply, and being able to dance with you wasn’t just a moment, it was a realization: sometimes, what we long for most arrives when we least expect it, and when it does, it teaches us gratitude more than excitement.
As we danced, the noise of the crowd, the brightness of the lights, and the presence of everyone else slowly lost their meaning. My attention rested only on you. In a world full of distractions, I learned that connection happens when two people choose to be present for each other. I felt the warmth of your hand, and in that simple touch, I understood how powerful quiet moments can be.
You were the one I wanted to be with that night, and honestly, I didn’t want to go home. Not because of the place, but because peace feels different when you are beside me.
Dancing with you, holding your hand, hearing “Treat Me Like a Rose” and then “This I Promise You” — those weren’t just songs. They became memories that taught me something valuable: the most meaningful moments in life are not planned for perfection, but felt with sincerity.
That night didn’t just make me smile.
It taught me what it means to cherish someone in the middle of a busy, noisy world — and still find calm in just one person.

      As we grew closer and closer, being together became something we both naturally wanted.
I still remember the first time we held hands.
That simple moment already felt like a victory.
It was quiet, but inside me, everything was loud — my heart racing faster than I could control. Until now, I still find it hard to explain what it truly felt like. Because some emotions, especially the ones born from genuine connection, cannot be understood through words alone. You have to experience them to realize their meaning.
But if I try to put it into words, this is how it felt to me:
The world suddenly felt safe.
Even when the surroundings were full of noise and chaos, my heart became calm. In your hand, I found peace. Your touch, your presence — they were enough to quiet the fears I carried. The fear of being hurt again. The fear of trusting too much.
Yet through you, I learned something important: not everyone is the same. Some people are different for a reason. You are different, my love. You are rare. There is only one you, and no one else will ever replace what you are to me.
Because loving you did not only give me happiness —
it taught me courage.

      We would go home together after school.
Sometimes we were tired. Sometimes quiet. But we were together, and that was already enough. In those ordinary moments—when we were doing modules at our place—I began to feel the meaning of us more deeply. Not the loud kind of love, but the calm, steady one that grows in silence.
It taught me something important: love does not always show itself in grand gestures. Most of the time, it lives in the simple routines we choose to share.
Our walks were simple. Our plans were simple. Ice cream—your comfort food. Gently bringing food to your room so you would have something to eat. Not because I had to, but because caring means paying attention to the small things. I never wanted you to feel hungry, tired, or forgotten, even in the smallest ways.
All those days became special to me for one reason only—you were the one beside me.
Not because of the places we went.
Not because of the food we shared.
But because presence gives meaning to everything.
I will never get tired of saying that, love. Because I’ve learned this truth: when the right person is with you, even the most ordinary day becomes something worth remembering.
And for me, you were always that person.

      Our KTV moments together.
My voice may not be perfect, but my heart always is when I’m with you. As long as we’re together, everything already feels right. Singing beside you taught me something simple yet important: happiness doesn’t come from sounding good, it comes from sharing a moment with someone who matters.
In every song I choose, I choose you. Because in truth, all the songs I sing carry your name in them. And when I say “I can treat you better,” I don’t mean it as a line — I mean it as a promise I live by.
Cooking for you.
Picking you up.
Taking care of you.
Loving you.
Being there when you’re sick.
Supporting your dreams.
Real love is not measured by what we say, but by what we consistently do.
Everything you hope for, everything you work toward, I want to support as much as I can, while I still have the strength to show you how valuable you are to me. Not only through affection, but through commitment, patience, and respect.
And if the days come when we are both tired — when there are misunderstandings, quiet moments, or even tears — I won’t walk away. Not because love is easy, but because love is worth choosing even when it asks for strength.
You are not just someone I love.
You are someone who gives me rest — emotionally and mentally.
So if we can, love, let’s keep choosing each other.
Not because we are perfect,
but because we are willing to grow together.
Let’s not give up on what we are building, on what we already have.

      Look at us, biting our medals.
We were honor students that day, yet what made me prouder wasn’t the medal around my neck — it was the person standing beside me. Achievements feel different when they are shared with someone who understands your struggles, your effort, and your quiet sacrifices.
Yes, we look cute there, almost playful. But behind that smile is something deeper: two people who kept choosing to move forward despite pressure, fatigue, and doubt. That picture reminds me that success is not only about reaching the top, but about who walks with you on the way there.
You became more than just my partner in moments — you became my inspiration. Seeing you work hard, stay gentle, and remain strong in your own way pushed me to become better too. Not out of competition, but out of love. Because when you admire someone deeply, you don’t want to stay the same — you want to grow.
That medal symbolizes effort.
But you symbolize purpose.
You remind me why I try harder, why I stay focused, and why I believe that dreams are more beautiful when they are shared. With you, success is no longer just personal — it becomes meaningful, grounded, and worth celebrating.
So yes, we were honor students.
But more than that, we were two hearts learning that inspiration, love, and growth go hand in hand.
And that, to me, is the real achievement

      Our first family outing together — Jala-Jala.
Swimming, laughter, and new experiences — but more than that, it was a moment that brought our worlds closer. That day didn’t just give us memories; it quietly wove you into my life in a deeper way.
It was one of those times when love grows not through big words, but through shared spaces and simple presence. Seeing you there, comfortable with my family, made me realize something important: love is not only about two people — it is also about learning to belong in each other’s worlds.
That moment made me love you even more.
You didn’t just come with me — you became closer to the people who shaped me. And in that closeness, I saw a future that felt warmer, steadier, and more meaningful.
Because when someone starts to feel at home in your family,
they are no longer just part of your moments —
they are becoming part of your life.
And in Jala-Jala, love quietly became deeper.

      The Philippine Arena concert.
Before, it was only a dream of mine to have someone beside me there. I never imagined that person would be you. Yet life has a beautiful way of answering quiet wishes. Some dreams do not arrive loudly — they arrive in the form of someone who changes everything.
You became one of the dreams I was able to fulfill. I told you before, and I promised, that I would bring you there — and I did. Not to prove anything, but to honor a promise made with love. And that night was pure happiness.
Those hugs in the car.
Those simple kisses.
That feeling in my stomach — like butterflies reminding me that joy is real when shared with the right person.
That night, love, we didn’t just watch a concert. We created a memory. We turned a wish into something living, something real. It reminded me that the best moments in life are not about where you go, but about who you choose to bring with you.
And if I still have another dream, it is this:
to take you to more places,
to discover more worlds with you,
to experience more adventures,
and to build more memories where we are not just visitors — we are the story.
Because journeys become meaningful when two hearts walk them together.
And in every place I go,
I want you beside me.

      Tita’s birthday.
Before we went, we shared a quiet moment together. Just a lovely kiss — nothing loud, nothing rushed — only something soft that reminded me how safe love can feel.
Sometimes, affection does not need many words. In that small gesture, I felt calm, grounded, and ready to face the day. It taught me something: real comfort is not found in excitement, but in closeness that brings peace.
I miss those moments. Not because of the act itself, but because of what they carry — reassurance, care, and the feeling that someone understands you without speaking.
You are my comfort.
Not only in happy days,
but in ordinary ones too.
With you, love feels gentle, steady, and sincere.

      Outing with your family.
That day, mas lalo kitang nakilala, at mas lalo rin akong nakilala sa mga mahal mo sa buhay.
I realized na love isn’t just about being together in private, kundi about being comfortable with the people who matter to each of us.
I saw how you interact with your family, how you care, how you laugh, and it made me appreciate even more the person that you are.
Being there with you, I also learned that love isn’t just words — it’s in the small things we do for each other.
Even something simple, like sharing a Coke or helping out when needed, means a lot when it comes from the heart.
It reminded me that true care is shown in consistency, patience, and thoughtfulness — not just in big gestures.
I felt so grateful that day, because I could see how we’re slowly becoming part of each other’s lives in a deeper, more meaningful way.
It’s not about grand moments or perfection, it’s about presence, understanding, and building trust.
Being with you, and seeing how we both fit naturally with each other’s families, made me realize that love is also about harmony, respect, and mutual growth.
That outing wasn’t just a day out; it was a reminder that the best kind of love is patient, grounded, and aware of the people and the world around us.
It made me reflect on how I want to be the kind of person who can give you safety, comfort, and joy, not just now, but in all the moments that life will bring our way.
I left that day feeling even more certain:
I want to share not just my happiness, but my life with you — in all its simplicity, in all its challenges, and in all the quiet moments in between.

      My birthday.
Even if it was just the two of us, I was genuinely happy. That day taught me something simple yet powerful: happiness is not about how many people celebrate with you, but about who chooses to stay beside you.
You were already enough.
I didn’t feel the need to look for crowds or noise. I didn’t long to be surrounded by many friends. All I wanted was your presence. Because peace feels different when it comes from someone who truly understands you.
Life slowly showed me this truth: as we grow, our definition of joy changes. It becomes quieter, deeper, and more meaningful. Not about excitement, but about connection.
And on my birthday, love, I realized —
you weren’t just someone celebrating with me.
You were the reason the day felt worth celebrating.
Sometimes, the best gift is not something you open,
but someone who chooses to stay.
And that someone, for me, was you.

      Your first time in the church — and me in a full suit.
Admit it, I looked good that day.
But I’ll admit something too — you looked beautiful in a way that felt calm, graceful, and real.
That moment meant more to me than I could explain back then. I was genuinely happy — so happy that my tears came naturally. Not because of the place alone, but because of what the moment represented. It was your first time there, and you were beside me.
And more than that, it was also my first time standing in the tribune, and you were the first person to witness it.
Life teaches us that some milestones feel heavier in the heart when someone special is present. Achievements become more meaningful when they are shared, not displayed. Having you there reminded me that growth is not only about reaching a place, but about who sees you when you finally stand there.
That day, I didn’t just wear a suit.
I carried gratitude.
I carried purpose.
And I carried the quiet joy of knowing that the person I cared for was right beside me.
Because moments become unforgettable when love and faith meet in the same space.

      Our STI days — our school days.
We went through so much.
Misunderstandings.
Quiet moments.
Jealousy.
Times when loving each other felt heavy instead of easy.
Those were the days that truly tested us.
Because love is not proven when everything is smooth, but when things become difficult and you still choose to stay. There were moments when emotions were loud and patience felt thin, yet here we are — not perfect, but still standing together.
That taught me something important: relationships are not about avoiding problems, but about learning how to face them with humility, understanding, and commitment.
We are still here.
And every day, I choose you again.
Not because it is always comfortable,
not because it is always simple,
but because real love is a decision you make repeatedly, even when the heart is tired.
Choosing you is not just a feeling for me —
it is a promise I renew every day.
And as long as we continue to grow, listen, and hold each other with care,
I will keep choosing you.
